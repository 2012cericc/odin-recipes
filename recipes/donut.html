        Homemade doughnuts are a bit of a project, but they’re less work than you might think, 
        and the result is a truly great, hot, crisp doughnut. Once you’ve mastered this basic 
        recipe for a fluffy, yeasted doughnut, you can do pretty much anything you like in 
        terms of glazes, toppings and fillings.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1¼cups milk</li>
        <li>2¼teaspoons (one package) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>¼cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4¼cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out the dough</li>
        <li>2quarts neutral oil, for frying, plus more for the bowl.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using an electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, beat the eggs, butter, sugar and salt into the yeast mixture.</li>
        <li> Add half of the flour (2 cups plus 2 tablespoons), and mix until combined</li>
        <li>then mix in the rest of the flour until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl</li>
        <li>Add more flour, about 2 tablespoons at a time, if the dough is too wet</li>
        <li>If you’re using an electric mixer, the dough will probably become too thick to beat</li>
        <li>when it does, transfer it to a floured surface, and gently knead it until smooth</li>
        <li>Grease a large bowl with a little oil</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to the bowl, and cover</li>
        <li>Let rise at room temperature until it doubles in size, about 1 hour</li>
        <li>etc</li>
    </ol>
